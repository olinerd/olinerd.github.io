<p>I joined <a href="http://www.bluefinrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Bluefin Robotics</a> in the manufacturing department, diagnosing and repairing issues with custom PCBAs and COTS sensor systems. I later became deputy technical lead on a US$12.5M USN program and managed several small projects.</p>
