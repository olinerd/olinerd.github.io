<p>I was the fifth employee hired at <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/" target="_blank">Rethink Robotics</a>, then known as Heartland Robotics. I contributed to the user-oriented design process of and prototyped electrical systems for what later became <a href="http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/baxter/" target="_blank">Baxter<a></a>.</a></p>
